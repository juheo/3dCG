# 3dCG
We proposed 3D choreography generation system based on [previous research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00818.pdf). We extracted 3D [bvh data](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html) from YouTube choreography using a [MonocularTotalCapture algorithm](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/MonocularTotalCapture) and trained the network using it.
