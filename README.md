# 3dCG
We extended 3D choreography generation system based on [previous research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00818.pdf). We extracted 3D bvh data from YouTube choreography using a [MonocularTotalCapture algorithm](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/MonocularTotalCapture) and trained the network using it.
